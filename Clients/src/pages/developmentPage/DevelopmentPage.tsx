        Features
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        The application boasts several notable features:
      </Typography>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Responsive Design: Material UI provides a sophisticated responsive
          design for the application, adhering to its principles to ensure
          responsiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Theme changing with different Game Types: Depending on the game type,
          the theme dynamically adjusts, altering the color scheme of number
          selections, lottery displays, and tickets.
        </li>
        <li>
          User Authentication: Users remain logged in after refreshing the page,
          thanks to JWT stored in local storage. In the event of refresh failure
          or expired tokens, users are redirected to the login page with token
          deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ticket Purchase, Validation, History, and Balance Top-Up: Users can
          seamlessly purchase and validate tickets, view their transaction
          history, and manage their balances, with all data fetched from the
          backend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ticket Persistence: Ticket data is preserved in local storage,
          ensuring retrieval after page refreshes when selecting the game type.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ticket Validation: All API requests undergo thorough validation both
          in the Backend and the Frontend.
        </li>
      </ul>
